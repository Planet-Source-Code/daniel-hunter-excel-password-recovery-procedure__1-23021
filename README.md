## Excel Password Recovery Procedure


</div>

### Description

this is a decent password recovery procedure for excel files. this is also my first submission, so let me know if you like it (or if you think it blows)

it is pretty basic. i have saved it in an excel file so that it can easily be used on any machine by any user who works with excel, but you could add some references, some forms, etc and compile it as a standalone application if you wanted to.

i have also included a pretty exhaustive (english) dictionary in this zip. you can substitute a different dictionary if you like.

i have made a brute-force (every possible password) cracker as well. i am working on a way to share proccessing power to distribute the job to multiple machines. this is because of the great length of time it takes to recover a password using that method. if anyone is interested, then i will post that here as well.
